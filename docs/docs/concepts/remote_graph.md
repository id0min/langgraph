# RemoteGraph

!!! note Prerequisites

    - [LangGraph Platform](./langgraph_platform.md)

## Overview

`RemoteGraph` is an interface that allows you to interact with a LangGraph Platform deployment as if it were a regular, locally-defined LangGraph graph (e.g. a `CompiledGraph`). 

## Connecting to a remote deployment

A `RemoteGraph` needs to be configured with the URL and API key of the deployment you want to interact with.

Please see the [how to interact with the deployment using RemoteGraph](../cloud/how-tos/remote_graph.md) guide for more information.

## Using RemoteGraph

Once you have connected to a remote deployment, you can interact with the graph in the same way you would with a local graph.

TODO: Add a sentence about using as a sub-graph maybe?
