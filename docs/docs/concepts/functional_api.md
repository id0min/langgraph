# Functional API

!!! warning "Beta"
    The Functional API is currently in **beta** and is subject to change. Please [report any issues](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/issues) or feedback to the LangGraph team. Use the label `#functional-api` when creating issues in Github.

## Overview

LangGraph's **Functional API** allows using standard control flow constructs (e.g., loops, conditionals) to define complex workflows without having to define a graph.

The **Functional API** runs on the same LangGraph runtime as the [**Graph API**](./low_level.md), providing access to features like [persistence](persistence.md), [human-in-the-loop](human_in_the_loop.md), and [streaming](streaming.md).

The **Functional API** and the **Graph API** can be used together in the same application, allowing you to intermix the two paradigms if needed.

## Example

Below we demonstrate a simple application that writes an essay and [interrupts](human_in_the_loop.md) to request human review.

```python
from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task

@task
def write_essay(topic: str) -> str:
    """Write an essay about the given topic."""
    time.sleep(1) # A placeholder for a long-running task.
    return f"An essay about topic: {topic}"

@entrypoint(checkpointer=MemorySaver())
def workflow(topic: str) -> dict:
    """A simple workflow that writes an essay and asks for a review."""
    essay = write_essay("cat").result()
    # Interrupt the workflow to get a review from a human.
    value = interrupt({ 
        # Any json-serializable value to surface to the client.
        "action": "review",
        "essay": essay
    })
    return {
        "essay": essay,
        "review": value,
    }
```

??? example "Detailed Explanation"

    This workflow will write an essay about the topic "cat" and then pause to get a review from a human. The workflow can be interrupted for an indefinite amount of time until a review is provided.

    When the workflow is resumed, it executes from the very start, but because the result of the `write_essay` task was already saved, the task result will be loaded from the checkpoint instead of being recomputed.

    ```python
    import time
    import uuid

    from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task
    from langgraph.types import interrupt
    from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

    @task
    def write_essay(topic: str) -> str:
        """Write an essay about the given topic."""
        time.sleep(1) # This is a placeholder for a long-running task.
        return f"An essay about topic: {topic}"

    @entrypoint(checkpointer=MemorySaver())
    def workflow(topic: str) -> dict:
        """A simple workflow that writes an essay and asks for a review."""
        essay = write_essay("cat").result()
        value = interrupt({
            # Any json-serializable value can be used here.
            "action": "review",
            "essay": essay
        })
        return {
            "essay": essay,
            "review": value,
        }

    thread_id = str(uuid.uuid4())

    config = {
        "configurable": {
            "thread_id": thread_id
        }
    }

    for item in workflow.stream("cat", config):
        print(item)
    ```

    ```python
    {'write_essay': 'An essay about topic: cat'}
    {'__interrupt__': (Interrupt(value={'action': 'review', 'essay': 'An essay about topic: cat'}, resumable=True, ns=['workflow:875155a0-97c1-7dc8-c216-f37c8d6b83c1'], when='during'),)}
    ```

    An essay has been written and is ready for review. Once the review is provided, we can resume the workflow:

    ```python
    from langgraph.types import Command

    for item in workflow.stream(Command(resume="This essay is great."), config):
        print(item)
    ```

    ```pycon
    {'workflow': {'essay': 'An essay about topic: cat', 'review': 'This essay is great.'}}
    ```

    The workflow has been completed and the review has been added to the essay.

## Building Blocks

The **Functional API** provides two primitives for building workflows:

- **[Entrypoint](#entrypoint)**: An **entrypoint** is a decorator that designates a function as the starting point of a LangGraph workflow. It encapsulates workflow logic and manages execution flow, including handling *long-running tasks* and [interrupts](human_in_the_loop.md).
- **[Task](#task)**: Represents a discrete unit of work, such as an API call or data processing step, that can be executed asynchronously from within an **entrypoint**. Invoking a **task** returns a future-like object, which can be awaited to obtain the result or resolved synchronously.

## Entrypoint

The `@entrypoint` decorator can be used to create a LangGraph workflow from a function. It encapsulates workflow logic and manages execution flow, including handling *long-running tasks* and [interrupts](./low_level.md#interrupt).

Entrypoints typically include a **checkpointer** to persist workflow state, enabling *resumption* from where it was *interrupted*.

### Definition

An **entrypoint** is defined by decorating a function with the `@entrypoint` decorator. 

The function **must accept a single positional argument**, which serves as the workflow input. If you need to pass multiple pieces of data, use a dictionary as the input type for the first argument.

Decorating a function with an `entrypoint` produces an instance of [EntrypointPregel][langgraph.func.EntrypointPregel] which helps to manage the execution of the workflow (e.g., handles streaming, resumption, and checkpointing).

You will usually want to pass a **checkpointer** to the `@entrypoint` decorator to enable persistence and use features like **human-in-the-loop**.

=== "Sync"

    ```python
    from langgraph.func import entrypoint

    @entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
    def my_workflow(some_input: dict) -> int:
        # some logic that may involve long-running tasks like API calls,
        # and may be interrupted for human-in-the-loop.
        ...
        return result
    ```

=== "Async"

    ```python
    from langgraph.func import entrypoint

    @entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
    async def my_workflow(some_input: dict) -> int:
        # some logic that may involve long-running tasks like API calls,
        # and may be interrupted for human-in-the-loop
        ...
        return result 
    ```

=== "StreamWriter"

    ```python
    from langchain.func import entrypoint

    @entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
    def my_workflow(some_input: dict, writer: StreamWriter) -> int:
        # some logic that may involve long-running tasks like API calls,
        # and may be interrupted for human-in-the-loop
        ...
        writer("some data")  # Write custom data to the `custom` stream
        ...
        writer("more data")  # Write more custom data to the `custom` stream
        return result
    ```

    See the [streaming custom data](#streaming-custom-data) section for more details.

=== "Long-term memory"

    The store is particularly useful for implementing [long-term memory](./memory.md#long-term-memory) in your workflows.

    ```python
    from langgraph.checkpoint.base import BaseStore
    from langgraph.func import entrypoint
    from langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStore

    in_memory_store = InMemoryStore(...)

    @entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer, store=in_memory_store)
    def my_workflow(some_input: dict, store: BaseStore) -> int:
        # some logic that may involve long-running tasks like API calls,
        # and may be interrupted for human-in-the-loop
    ```

=== "RunnableConfig"

    You can also request a [RunnableConfig](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/runnables/#runnableconfig) object to access the configuration passed to the entrypoint.

    ```python
    from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableConfig

    @entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
    def my_workflow(some_input: dict, config: RunnableConfig) -> int:
        # some logic that may involve long-running tasks like API calls,
        # and may be interrupted for human-in-the-loop
        print(config) # Access the configuration
        ...
    ```


!!! important "Serialization"

    The **inputs** and **outputs** of entrypoints must be JSON-serializable to support checkpointing. Please see the [serialization](#serialization) section for more details.

### Executing

Using the [`@entrypoint`](#entrypoint) yields a [EntrypointPregel][langgraph.func.EntrypointPregel] object that can be executed using the `invoke`, `ainvoke`, `stream`, and `astream` methods.

=== "Invoke"

    ```python
    my_workflow.invoke(some_input)  # Wait for the result synchronously
    ```

=== "Async Invoke"

    ```python
    await my_workflow.ainvoke(some_input)  # Await result asynchronously
    ```

=== "Stream"
    
    ```python
    for chunk in my_workflow.stream(some_input):
        print(chunk)
    ```

=== "Async Stream"

    ```python
    async for chunk in my_workflow.astream(some_input):
        print(chunk)
    ```

### Resuming

Execution can be **resumed** using the [Command][langgraph.types.Command] primitive.

=== "Invoke"

    ```python
    from langgraph.types import Command
    
    my_workflow.invoke(Command(resume=some_resume_value))
    ```

=== "Async Invoke"

    ```python
    from langgraph.types import Command
    
    await my_workflow.ainvoke(Command(resume=some_resume_value))
    ```

=== "Stream"

    ```python
    from langgraph.types import Command
    
    for chunk in my_workflow.stream(Command(resume=some_resume_value)):
        print(chunk)
    ```

=== "Async Stream"

    ```python
    from langgraph.types import Command

    async for chunk in my_workflow.astream(Command(resume=some_resume_value)):
        print(chunk)
    ```


## Task

A **task** represents a discrete unit of work, such as an API call or data processing step, that can be executed asynchronously. Invoking a **task** returns a future, which can be waited on to obtain the result.

### Definition

Tasks are defined using the `@task` decorator, which wraps a regular Python function.

```python
from langgraph.func import task

@task()
def slow_computation(input_value):
    # Simulate a long-running operation
    ...
    return result
```

!!! important "Serialization"

    The **outputs** of tasks must be JSON-serializable to support checkpointing.

### Execution

**Tasks** can only be called from within an **entrypoint**, another **task**, or a [state graph node](./low_level.md#nodes). They **cannot** be called directly from the main application code. Calling a **task** produces a future-like object that can be awaited or resolved to obtain the result.

=== "Synchronous Invocation"

    ```python
    @entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
    def my_workflow(some_input: int) -> int:
        future = slow_computation(some_input)
        return future.result()  # Wait for the result synchronously
    ```

=== "Asynchronous Invocation"

    ```python
    @entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
    async def my_workflow(some_input: int) -> int:
        return await slow_computation(some_input)  # Await result asynchronously
    ```

## When to use a task

**Tasks** are useful in the following scenarios:

- **Resumable Graph Execution**: When graph execution may need to be **resumed** after being **interrupted** (e.g., for **human-in-the-loop**), **tasks** can encapsulate any source of non-determinism, such as API calls, database queries, or random number generation. See the [determinism](#determinism) for more details.
- **Retryable Work**: When work needs to be retried to handle failures or inconsistencies, **tasks** provide a way to encapsulate and manage the retry logic.
- **Parallel Execution**: For I/O-bound tasks, **tasks** enable parallel execution, allowing multiple operations to run concurrently without blocking (e.g., calling multiple APIs).
 
## Patterns

Below are a few simple patterns that show examples of how to use the **Functional API**.

When defining an `entrypoint`, input is restricted to the first argument of the function. To pass multiple inputs, you can use a dictionary.

```python
@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def my_workflow(inputs: dict) -> int:
    value = inputs["value"]
    another_value = inputs["another_value"]
    return value

my_workflow.invoke({"value": 1, "another_value": 2})  
```

### Parallel execution

Tasks can be executed in parallel by invoking them concurrently and waiting for the results. This is useful for improving performance in IO bound tasks (e.g., calling APIs for LLMs).

```python
@task
def add_one(number: int) -> int:
    return number + 1

@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def graph(numbers: list[int]) -> list[str]:
    futures = [add_one(i) for i in numbers]
    return [f.result() for f in futures]
```

### Calling subgraphs

The **Functional API** and the [**Graph API**](./low_level.md) can be used together in the same application as they share the same underlying runtime.

```python
from langgraph.func import entrypoint
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

builder = StateGraph()
...
some_graph = builder.compile()

@entrypoint()
def some_workflow(some_input: dict) -> int:
    # Call a graph defined using the graph API
    result_1 = some_graph.invoke(...)
    # Call another graph defined using the graph API
    result_2 = another_graph.invoke(...)
    return {
        "result_1": result_1,
        "result_2": result_2
    }
```

### Calling other entrypoints

You can call other **entrypoints** from within an **entrypoint** or a **task**.

```python
@entrypoint() # Will automatically use the checkpointer from the parent entrypoint
def some_other_workflow(inputs: dict) -> int:
    return inputs["value"]

@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def my_workflow(inputs: dict) -> int:
    value = some_other_workflow.invoke({"value": 1})
    return value
```

### Streaming custom data

You can stream custom data from an **entrypoint** by using the `StreamWriter` type. This allows you to write custom data to the `custom` stream.

```python
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task
from langgraph.types import StreamWriter

@task
def add_one(x):
    return x + 1

@task
def add_two(x):
    return x + 2

checkpointer = MemorySaver()

@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def main(inputs, writer: StreamWriter) -> int:
    """A simple workflow that adds one and two to a number."""
    writer("hello") # Write some data to the `custom` stream
    add_one(inputs['number']).result() # Will write data to the `updates` stream
    writer("world") # Write some more data to the `custom` stream
    add_two(inputs['number']).result() # Will write data to the `updates` stream
    return 5 

config = {
    "configurable": {
        "thread_id": "1"
    }
}

for chunk in main.stream({"number": 1}, stream_mode=["custom", "updates"], config=config):
    print(chunk)
```

```pycon
('updates', {'add_one': 2})
('updates', {'add_two': 3})
('custom', 'hello')
('custom', 'world')
('updates', {'main': 5})
```

!!! important

    The `writer` parameter is automatically injected at run time. It will only be injected if the 
    parameter name appears in the function signature with that *exact* name.


### Retry policy

```python
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task
from langgraph.types import RetryPolicy

attempts = 0

# Let's configure the RetryPolicy to retry on ValueError.
# The default RetryPolicy is optimized for retrying specific network errors.
retry_policy = RetryPolicy(retry_on=ValueError)

@task(retry=retry_policy) 
def get_info():
    global attempts
    attempts += 1

    if attempts < 2:
        raise ValueError('Failure')
    return "OK"

checkpointer = MemorySaver()

@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def main(inputs, writer):
    return get_info().result()

config = {
    "configurable": {
        "thread_id": "1"
    }
}

main.invoke({'any_input': 'foobar'}, config=config)
```

```pycon
'OK'
```

### Resuming after an error

```python
import time
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from langgraph.func import entrypoint, task
from langgraph.types import StreamWriter, RetryPolicy

# Global variable to track the number of attempts
attempts = 0

@task()
def get_info():
    """
    Simulates a task that fails once before succeeding.
    Raises an exception on the first attempt, then returns "OK" on subsequent tries.
    """
    global attempts
    attempts += 1

    if attempts < 2:
        raise ValueError("Failure")  # Simulate a failure on the first attempt
    return "OK"

# Initialize an in-memory checkpointer for persistence
checkpointer = MemorySaver()

@task
def slow_task():
    """
    Simulates a slow-running task by introducing a 1-second delay.
    """
    time.sleep(1)
    return "Ran slow task."

@entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
def main(inputs, writer: StreamWriter):
    """
    Main workflow function that runs the slow_task and get_info tasks sequentially.

    Parameters:
    - inputs: Dictionary containing workflow input values.
    - writer: StreamWriter for streaming custom data.

    The workflow first executes `slow_task` and then attempts to execute `get_info`,
    which will fail on the first invocation.
    """
    slow_task_result = slow_task().result()  # Blocking call to slow_task
    get_info().result()  # Exception will be raised here on the first attempt
    return slow_task_result

# Workflow execution configuration with a unique thread identifier
config = {
    "configurable": {
        "thread_id": "1"  # Unique identifier to track workflow execution
    }
}

# This invocation will take ~1 second due to the slow_task execution
try:
    # First invocation will raise an exception due to the `get_info` task failing
    main.invoke({'any_input': 'foobar'}, config=config)
except ValueError:
    pass  # Handle the failure gracefully
```

When we resume execution, we won't need to re-run the `slow_task` as its result is already saved in the checkpoint.

```python
main.invoke(None, config=config)
```

```pycon
'Ran slow task.'
```

## Serialization

There are two key aspects to serialization in LangGraph:

1. `@entrypoint` inputs and outputs must be JSON-serializable.
2. `@task` outputs must be JSON-serializable.

These requirements are necessary for enabling checkpointing and workflow resumption. Use python primitives
like dictionaries, lists, strings, numbers, and booleans to ensure that your inputs and outputs are serializable.

Serialization ensures that workflow state, such as task results and intermediate values, can be reliably saved and restored. This is critical for enabling human-in-the-loop interactions, fault tolerance, and parallel execution.

Providing non-serializable inputs or outputs will result in a runtime error when a workflow is configured with a checkpointer.

## Determinism

To utilize features like **human-in-the-loop**, any randomness should be encapsulated inside of **tasks**. This guarantees that when execution is halted (e.g., for human in the loop) and then resumed, it will follow the same *sequence of steps*, even if **task** results are non-deterministic.

LangGraph achieves this behavior by persisting **task** and [**subgraph**](./low_level.md#subgraphs) results as they execute. A well-designed workflow ensures that resuming execution follows the *same sequence of steps*, allowing previously computed results to be retrieved correctly without having to re-execute them. This is particularly useful for long-running **tasks** or **tasks** with non-deterministic results, as it avoids repeating previously done work and allows resuming from essentially the same 

While different runs of a workflow can produce different results, resuming a **specific** run should always follow the same sequence of recorded steps. This allows LangGraph to efficiently look up **task** and **subgraph** results that were executed prior to the graph being interrupted and avoid recomputing them.

## Idempotency

Idempotency ensures that running the same operation multiple times produces the same result. This helps prevent duplicate API calls and redundant processing if a step is rerun due to a failure. Always place API calls inside **tasks** functions for checkpointing, and design them to be idempotent in case of re-execution. Re-execution can occur if a **task** starts, but does not complete successfully. Then, if the workflow is resumed, the **task** will run again. Use idempotency keys or verify existing results to avoid duplication.

## Functional API vs. Graph API

The **Functional API** and the **Graph APIs** provide two different paradigms to create workflows in LangGraph. Here are some key differences:

- **Control flow**: The Functional API does not require thinking about graph structure. You can use standard Python constructs to define workflows.
- **State management**: The **GraphAPI** requires declaring a [**State**](./low_level.md#state) and may require defining [**reducers**](./low_level.md#reducers) to manage updates to the graph state. `@entrypoint` and `@tasks` do not require explicit state management as their state is scoped to the function and is not shared across functions.
- **Checkpointing**: Both APIs generate and use checkpoints. In the **Graph API** a new checkpoint is generated after every [superstep](./low_level.md). In the **Functional API**, when tasks are executed, their results are saved to an existing checkpoint associated with the given entrypoint instead of creating a new checkpoint.
- **Visualization**: The Graph API makes it easy to visualize the workflow as a graph which can be useful for debugging, understanding the workflow, and sharing with others.

## Common Pitfalls

### Handling side effects

Side effects, such as writing to a file or sending an email, should be encapsulated in tasks to ensure consistent execution upon resumption.

=== "Incorrect"

    In this example, a side effect (writing to a file) is directly included in the workflow, making resumption inconsistent.

    ```python
    @entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
    def my_workflow(inputs: dict) -> int:
        # This code will be executed a second time when resuming the workflow.
        # Which is likely not what you want.
        # highlight-next-line
        with open("output.txt", "w") as f:
            # highlight-next-line
            f.write("Side effect executed")
        value = interrupt("question")
        return value
    ```

=== "Correct"

    In this example, the side effect is encapsulated in a task, ensuring consistent execution upon resumption.

    ```python
    from langgraph.func import task

    # highlight-next-line
    @task
    # highlight-next-line
    def write_to_file():
        with open("output.txt", "w") as f:
            f.write("Side effect executed")

    @entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
    def my_workflow(inputs: dict) -> int:
        # The side effect is now encapsulated in a task.
        write_to_file().result()
        value = interrupt("question")
        return value
    ```

### Non-deterministic control flow

[Non-deterministic control flow](#determinism) can lead to inconsistent results when resuming a workflow. To ensure correct behavior, encapsulate non-deterministic operations (e.g., random number generation, time-based logic) inside **tasks**.

=== "Incorrect"

    In this example, the workflow uses the current time to determine which task to execute. This is non-deterministic because the result of the workflow depends on the time at which it is executed.

    ```python
    from langgraph.func import entrypoint

    @entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
    def my_workflow(inputs: dict) -> int:
        t0 = inputs["t0"]
        # highlight-next-line
        t1 = time.time()
        
        delta_t = t1 - t0
        
        if delta_t > 1:
            result = slow_task(1).result()
            value = interrupt("question")
        else:
            result = slow_task(2).result()
            value = interrupt("question")
            
        return {
            "result": result,
            "value": value
        }
    ```

=== "Correct"

    In this example, the workflow uses the input `t0` to determine which task to execute. This is deterministic because the result of the workflow depends only on the input.

    ```python
    import time
    from langgraph.func import task

    # highlight-next-line
    @task
    # highlight-next-line
    def get_time() -> float:
        return time.time()

    @entrypoint(checkpointer=checkpointer)
    def my_workflow(inputs: dict) -> int:
        t0 = inputs["t0"]
        # highlight-next-line
        t1 = get_time().result()
        
        delta_t = t1 - t0
        
        if delta_t > 1:
            result = slow_task(1).result()
            value = interrupt("question")
        else:
            result = slow_task(2).result()
            value = interrupt("question")
            
        return {
            "result": result,
            "value": value
        }
    ```
